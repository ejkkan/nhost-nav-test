# Project Setup

To start the project, follow these steps:

1. Run `nhost up` in the root directory.
2. Navigate to the `web` directory, install deps and run `pnpm run dev`.

This will start the development server and you can begin working on the project.

Notice how the nhost client loses it's state and the page has to be reloaded to hydrate it again.
